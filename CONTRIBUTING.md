## Setting up Your Dev Environment

This project requires `Xcode 16` and `Swift 6`.

Additionally, it makes use of [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to
maintain consistent code formatting. You can install it via Homebrew, like so:

```bash
brew install swiftformat
```

And you're done!
