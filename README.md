# Maeve

A cute little side project I’m building in public. Will (eventually) be a simple iOS weather
app that provides the high low, and current temperature for the day, perhaps with some fun
additional little features, as inspiration strikes.

## 📆 Up Next…

- [ ] Start tracking a dependency diagram for this project to inform architecture choices
- [ ] Display the high and low temperature using a free (preferably open-source) weather API
- [ ] Stop just goofing around and finally set up tests and CI for things
