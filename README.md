# Maeve

A cute little side project Iâ€™m building in public. Will (eventually) be a simple iOS weather
app that provides the high low, and current temperature for the day, perhaps with some fun
additional little features, as inspiration strikes.

## Setting up Dev Environment

This project requires `Xcode 16` and `Swift 6`.

Additionally, it makes use of [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to
enforce consistent code formatting. You can install SwiftFormat using Homebrew, like so:

```bash
brew install swiftformat
```

And your done!
