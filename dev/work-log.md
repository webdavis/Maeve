# Work Log for the Maeve Weather Application

This file is here to help me stay organized. For now, my goal is to log just 5 minutes of work
each day. Iâ€™m still getting the hang of it, so building consistency is my top priority.

- 1:37h (1313-1450): Getting project started.
  - Started this log.
  - Just because it's been a while, I built and ran Maeve in Xcode to confirm that it still does "that."
  - Refactored the property names in `WeatherStatusViewController` so that they are more abstract and support future refactorings.
  - Added a weather symbol to accompany the weather description.
